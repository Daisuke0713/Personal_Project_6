# Personal_Project_6

Implementation of an interpreter in C that translates Scheme code. I enjoy writing code in Scheme as it is a functional programming language heavily based on recursion that can internally perform the tail call optimization to reduce the amount of memory to be used. This project will improve my understanding of an interpreter and how a functional language works in general.
